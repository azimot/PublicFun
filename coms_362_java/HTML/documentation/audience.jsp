		<p>jTunes was created for people who are on the go.  We don't single out any
		demographic.  Our interfaces are very easy to use and clutter free so even the 
		most computer illiterate person can use our site.</p>
		<p>The only criteria for being in our target audience is that you have music, and you go places.</p>
		<p>It's that simple</p>
		<p>It is perfect for people that don't want to worry about taking their music with them.</p>
