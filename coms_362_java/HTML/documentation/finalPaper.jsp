			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<div class="plainText overview">
				<p>A lot of work was put into building this website.  For all three of us 
				it was the first time we had built a website.  It has been fun to see the 
				site grow from a few lines of html, to a full-fleged dynamic webpage.</p>
				<br class="noPad" />
				<p>Through our trials and tribulations we have all learned a lot.  
				The biggest thing we learned is, we really don't know how to make interaction
				diagrams.  Of course, by the end, that has changed.  The diagrams present with
				this final iteration of the site are top notch.</p>
				<br class="noPad" />
				<p>We are all really happy that we documented and designed our site before throwing 
				lines of code at the computer to try to build a website.  It is much easier to build 
				something with a good set of blueprints rather than trying to throw together some bricks.</p>
